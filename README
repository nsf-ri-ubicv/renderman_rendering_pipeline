Here are some rough installation instructions that might work:

1) install the dependencies:

        0.) Python >= 2.7.   You need 2.7 for the OrderedDict object.   (I could install a workaround here if this code is "released.")

	i) boto 
		a) get the latest version and install it (http://code.google.com/p/boto/wiki/BotoConfig)
		b) set up a boto config file in ~/.boto containing the AWS ID and secret 
		   id keys (like for Starcluster)
		   		   
			If you are getting the following error:
			AttributeError: S3Connection instance has no attribute 'aws_secret_access_key'
			You'll have to update your boto config.

	ii) tornado (install version 1.2)

	iii) lib3ds   http://code.google.com/p/lib3ds/
	
	iv) 3delight   http://www.3delight.com/en/

	v) cgkit.  
	    a) get it from my repo, https://github.com/yamins81/cgkit  
	    b) follow in the instructions in the readme
	
	vi) mongodb
		a) get the software and install it (if at all possible, use the package
		   repos at the bottom of http://www.mongodb.org/downloads
		b) start the db  (e.g. run the "mongod" command with relevant arguments)
	
	
	For the frontend:
    	vii) pymongo (http://api.mongodb.org/python/1.9%2B/index.html)
	
	    viii) sass.  assuming you have ruby installed, run "gem install haml"
	    
	    
	    
	
2) To run the backend (the actual pipeline):
    
    a) go to source directory.  
    b) run "python api.py"
    
    If b) works, then, the REST interface should be available on localhost:9999
    
    That is, if you sent the right parameters to localhost:9999/render?, you'd get back (eventually)
    a zip file containing the rendered images. 
    
    The API documentation is in the code itself, but it's poorly documented right now. 


    
3) To run the frontend:
    
	i) create some local DBs:
	    a) to the source dir
	    b) run "python construct_images.py"
	    
    ii) start the frontend server
        a) go to the "frontend" directory within the source directory
        b) run "make source"
    
    If b) works, then the frontend should be available on localhost:8000.
