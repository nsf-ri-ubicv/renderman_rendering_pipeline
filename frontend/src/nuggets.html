        On this page, we will describe some nuggets of wisdom about our wonderful and beautiful models.  <br/> <br/>
        Yes. 
        </div>
        
        <div class="nugget" id="nugget1">
            <div class="innernugget">
                <div class="nuggetheader"> 1) Mixed up categories.</div>
                <div class="nuggettext">This is a first nugget, about the result of mixing up categories.  Shown are test accuracy performance statistics
                for a bunch of two-level (gridded gabor/random) models.   There are three problems (the tenway problem, cars vs planes, 
                and furniture (chairs and tables) vs. animals (dogs and cats and reptiles) vs. vehicles (cars and boats and planes).  <br/><br/>
                The control task is the actual category, while the "mixed up" task is one where the 3dmodels in the category have been shuffled, e.g.
                cars vs planes becomes [one group of mixed cars and planes] vs [another random of cars and planes].<br/><br/>
                Results are further broken down by which invariances were used: All, meaning translation, scaling, and inplane and out-of-plane rotation; 
                translation only; and inplane rotation only.
                </div>
                <div class="nuggetplot" id="grid1" style="width:550px;height:350px;"></div>
                <div class="nuggettext">The key thing to notice is that rotation is much harder than translation; and 
                that mixing up the categories has an effect.  (I will write more text later.)    
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="nugget" id="nugget2">
            <div class="innernugget">
                <div class="nuggetheader"> 2) Animals, Guns & Faces.</div>
                <div class="nuggettext"> Below is an exploration of the 45 two-way category (2-CAT) comparisons
                contained in the 10-way class comparison above.  I evaluated 5 models for each two comparison,
                with the control (non-mixed-up) task with both translation-only and in-plane-rotation only, and the 
                mixed-up task with translation only. I've plotted the mean values for each, and differences
                between the first and second (T-I) and first and third (T-M).
                I'm especially interested in identifying 2-CAT problems for which T, T-I and T-M are all high, because 
                these should be the simplest "carriers of the phenotype" of what seems to be biggest problem facing the Thor models.
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div style="width:100%;overflow:auto">
                    <div class="nuggettext" style="float:left;width:330px;">    
                    So let's notice a couple of things.<br/><br/>
                         <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;list-style-position:inside">
                            <li>Some two-problems are much harder than others for rotational invariance. <br/><br/>
                            </li>
                            <li>Animals seem to be screwing everything up.  Sort on "T-I" in the table to the right.<br/><br/> 
                            </li>
                            <li>Face and guns make things easier.  Sort on "Trans". <br/><br/>
                            </li>
                         </ol>
                    This suggests that probably study e.g. reptiles vs. planes or cats_and_dogs is a reasonable simplification.
